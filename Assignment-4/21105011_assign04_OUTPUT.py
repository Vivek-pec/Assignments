Question 1 is:

Number of discs: 4

A is the initial rod
B is the extra rod
C is the final rod

Steps:
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 2 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 3 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 1 from rod C to rod A
Move disk 2 from rod C to rod B
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 4 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 2 from rod B to rod A
Move disk 1 from rod C to rod A
Move disk 3 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 2 from rod A to rod C
7Move disk 1 from rod B to rod C

Number of steps will be: 15

Question 2 is:

Enter the number of rows you want to print: 7
The Pascal's Triangle using recursion is:
      1 
     1 1 
    1 2 1 
   1 3 3 1 
  1 4 6 4 1 
 1 5 10 10 5 1 
1 6 15 20 15 6 1 
Pascal's Triangle using iteration is:
      1 
     1 1 
    1 2 1 
   1 3 3 1 
  1 4 6 4 1 
 1 5 10 10 5 1 
1 6 15 20 15 6 1 

Question 3 is:

Enter first integer value(dividend): 163
Enter second integer value(divisor): 23

Quotient: 7 
Remainder: 2

a. Check whether the function (divmod()) is callable or not:
True, which means it is callable

b. Check whether all the values are zero or not:
All values in result(i.e. quotient and remainder) are non-zero.

c. Add (4,5,6) to the result and filter out values greater than 4:
Values greater than 4(in list format) are: [5, 6, 7]

d. Convert the above result into a set datatype:
The output of previous part in set datatype would be: {5, 6, 7}

e. Make the set immutable:
The immutable set would be: frozenset({5, 6, 7})

f. Evaluate the maximum value from the set and find out its hash value:
The maximum value from the set is: 7
The hash value of 7(considering it to be integer) is 7 and its hash value is 5088920397829976550(if we consider 7 as a string).

Question 4 is:

Enter name of student: Vivek Jaiswal
Enter SID of Vivek Jaiswal: 21105011
Object Created

The name of the student is Vivek Jaiswal and his/her roll number is 21105011

Object destroyed

Question 5 is:

The current database is:
Mehak has a salary of 40000 rupees
Ashok has a salary of 50000 rupees
Viren has a salary of 60000 rupees

a. Updated the salary of Mehak from 40000 to 70000

b. Deleted the record of Viren(whose salary is 60000)

The final database is:
Mehak has a salary of 70000 rupees
Ashok has a salary of 50000 rupees

Question 6 is:

Enter word uttered by George: Love
Enter word made by Barbie: Love

Do you want to consider same no. of letters also? y

Barbie has made a valid word!

Do you want to check whether the word made by Barbie it is meaningful or not? y

The word is meaningful.

Their friendship is true.
